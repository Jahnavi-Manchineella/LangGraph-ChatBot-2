## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. 📦 Install Everything

pip install langgraph langchain langchain_groq langchain_community arxiv wikipedia
2. 🔐 Add Your Groq API Key
In Google Colab:

python:

from google.colab import userdata
userdata.set('groq_api_key', 'YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY')
Or in the terminal:


export GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
3. 🧪 Run the Chatbot
Open the notebook or Python script and start chatting!

💬 Example Interaction

🧑 User: Can you summarize the latest research on AI safety?

🤖 Chatbot: Sure! Fetching the most recent Arxiv papers on AI safety...
✨ Fun Ideas You Can Try
🧪 Ask about current tech trends, and it will fetch papers from Arxiv.

📚 Use it to study by asking historical or scientific facts (Wikipedia-powered).

🤯 Push it to its limits by mixing domains: “Tell me how quantum computing affects neural networks.”

🛠️ Advanced Tips
Use LangGraph to build branching conversations with memory.

Modify the LangChain tool list to include more APIs (e.g., Wolfram Alpha, news APIs).

Combine with a React front-end for a slick chatbot UI.
